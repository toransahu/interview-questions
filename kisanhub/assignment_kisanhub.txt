1. Data parsing and modelling - Server side - use Python + Django or any other 
    Python web framework you are comfortable with. 

    1.1 Use above URL and write code to programatically download the data for 
        Max temp, Min temp, Mean temp, Sunshine, and Rainfall for 
        UK, England, Wales, and Scotland regions. 
        
    1.2 Create appropriate data model using Django ORM to store the above data.
    
    1.3 Write code to store all of the downloaded data from 1.1 in the data 
        model built in 1.2 (please use database engine of your choice). 
        The file download and data storing process has to be fully automated 
        and user should be able to run it multiple times without 
        any duplication of data etc. 

2. Build a visualisation component for this dataset using HTML5, CSS, AngularJS
    or JS (feel free to decide what JS libraries you use). 
    How will you present this data to the user? What kind of plots/charts will 
    you use? How will the data grids look like? Use your imagination and creativity.

3. Take Q2 forward and find 3 interesting facts from the above dataset and present it to us.
