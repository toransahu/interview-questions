Please find the questions in the subdirectories.

Important Notes to crack the first round of PromptCloud recruitment : 

 
1. For programming questions, we expect you to write clean and readable working code in ruby/python. You can solve the program in Java/Cpp/C too but we'd strongly encourage you to solve at least one question in ruby or python.

2. Please write well structured code(for example don't write all your logic in constructor :). Also use meaningful variable names; try to avoid variable like a(for array), n(for number) etc. Using meaningful variables surely going to increase your rating in this coding round.

3. If your program expects input, then it should take input from a file "input.txt" and write output to "output.txt". These files will be in the same directory where the program is. DON'T take your input from keyboard, like scanf, cin or using Scanner.in. Please note that, failing of this requirement will mark your code as WRONG, because we check this part in automated way via a program. So,  please take this point number 3 very seriously. 

3. Please do error handling properly and add exception handling etc. whereever appropriate.

4. Additional points if write unit test for your program too :)

6.Now, how we will test your program? When our technical committee will review your answers, they will not test your code using manual inputs given from keyboard. Instead, they will only run your program and check the output.txt against few predefined test-case.

E.g 	If you write your code in C, the committee will only use ./a.out ; for Java java <ClassName>; for python, python <filename>.  If your program outputs correct result in the 'outout.txt' file, then your code is marked correct.
